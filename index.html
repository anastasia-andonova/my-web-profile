<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modeling</strong></li>
            <p>I love to do modeling as a hobby, which also pays well. It is fun and I get to meet fascinating people.</p>
        <li><strong>Dancing</strong></li> 
            <p>I used to do dancing professionally, go to international competitions and win medals. Now I don’t do it professionally, but for my own pleasure.</p>
        <li><strong>Piano</strong></li>
            <p>My parents gave me to a music school, which I hated when I was small. However I now understand the grace and elegance of being able to play the piano.</p>
